            "Eccentric scientist Rintarou Okabe has a never-ending thirst for scientific exploration. Together with his ditzy but well-meaning friend Mayuri Shiina and his roommate Itaru Hashida, Okabe founds the Future Gadget Laboratory in the hopes of creating technological innovations that baffle the human psyche. Despite claims of grandeur, the only notable \"gadget\" the trio have created is a microwave that has the mystifying power to turn bananas into green goo.\n\nHowever, when Okabe attends a conference on time travel, he experiences a series of strange events that lead him to believe that there is more to the \"Phone Microwave\" gadget than meets the eye. Apparently able to send text messages into the past using the microwave, Okabe dabbles further with the \"time machine,\" attracting the ire and attention of the mysterious organization SERN.\n\nDue to the novel discovery, Okabe and his friends find themselves in an ever-present danger. As he works to mitigate the damage his invention has caused to the timeline, Okabe fights a battle to not only save his loved ones but also to preserve his degrading sanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        <p>
            "Humans and demons are two sides of the same coin, as are Assiah and Gehenna, their respective worlds. The only way to travel between the realms is by the means of possession, like in ghost stories. However, Satan, the ruler of Gehenna, cannot find a suitable host to possess and therefore, remains imprisoned in his world. In a desperate attempt to conquer Assiah, he sends his son instead, intending for him to eventually grow into a vessel capable of possession by the demon king.\n\nAo no Exorcist follows Rin Okumura who appears to be an ordinary, somewhat troublesome teenagerâ€”that is until one day he is ambushed by demons. His world turns upside down when he discovers that he is in fact the very son of Satan and that his demon father wishes for him to return so they can conquer Assiah together. Not wanting to join the king of Gehenna, Rin decides to begin training to become an exorcist so that he can fight to defend Assiah alongside his brother Yukio.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"

One hot summer day, his childhood friend, Meiko \"Menma\" Honma, appears and pesters him to grant a forgotten wish. He pays her no mind, which annoys her, but he doesn't really care. After all, Menma already died years ago.\n\nAt first, Jinta thinks that he is merely hallucinating due to the summer heat, but he is later on convinced that what he sees truly is the ghost of Menma. Jinta and his group of childhood friends grew apart after her untimely death, but they are drawn together once more as they try to lay Menma's spirit to rest. Re-living their pain and guilt, will they be able to find the strength to help not only Menma move onâ€”but themselves as well?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]"
